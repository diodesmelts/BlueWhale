# Blue Whale Competitions - Vercel Deployment

This is an ultra-simplified version of the Blue Whale Competitions platform specifically for Vercel deployment.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main landing page
- `api/status.js` - Simple API endpoint
- `vercel.json` - Minimal Vercel configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. Create a new Vercel project
2. Point to this directory (`standalone`)
3. Deploy! No additional configuration needed

## Why This Structure?

This is the absolute simplest structure that works with Vercel. It contains:
- Pure HTML (no server-side rendering)
- A single API endpoint following Vercel's serverless format
- Minimal configuration

## Important Notes

This is a placeholder landing page. Once deployment is working correctly, we can gradually add more functionality.
